The functions in this module control the Babeltrace library's logging
behaviour.

You can set the current global log level of the library with
bt_logging_set_global_level(). Note that, if the level you set is below
the minimal logging level (configured at build time, which you can get
with bt_logging_get_minimal_level()), the logging statement between the
current global log level and the minimal log level are not executed.
