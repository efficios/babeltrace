NAME
----
babeltrace-source.ctf.fs - Babeltrace's file system CTF source
component class


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Babeltrace compcls:source.ctf.fs component class, provided by the
man:babeltrace-plugin-ctf(7) plugin, once instantiated, opens one or
more http://diamon.org/ctf/[CTF] traces on the file system and emits the
notifications of their data streams on its output ports.


Operation
~~~~~~~~~
A compcls:source.ctf.fs component recurses the directory given by the
param:path parameter to find CTF traces. Note that, since a CTF trace
directory cannot contain another CTF trace, if you need to open a single
trace, set the param:path parameter to a directory which directly
contains the `metadata` file.

For each trace, the component creates one output port per effective data
stream. Multiple data stream files can constitute a single effective
data stream. The name of a data stream output port is the absolute path
to the corresponding data stream file, or to one of the corresponding
data stream files if there's more than one.

The component skips the following files when looking for data stream
files:

* Any file which starts with `.`, including subdirectories.
* Any non-regular file.


[[trace-naming]]
Trace naming
~~~~~~~~~~~~
A compcls:source.ctf.fs component names each trace `[HOSTNAME/]PATH`,
with:

`HOSTNAME`::
    Value of the trace's `hostname` environment constant. If this
    environment constant does not exist, or if its value is not a
    string, then this part is omitted.

`PATH`::
    Relative path to the trace, starting at and including the basename
    of the param:path parameter. This path is normalized, that is, it
    doesn't contain path elements named `..` or `.`.

For example, assume the following hierarchy:

----
/
  home/
    user/
      my-traces/
        trace1/
          metadata
          ...
        node-traces/
          server/
            metadata
            ...
          client/
            metadata
            ...
----

If you set the param:path parameter to `/home/user/my-traces`, and
assuming the hostname of the `trace1` and `server` traces is `machine`,
and the hostname of the `client` trace is `embedded`, then the trace
names are:

* `machine/my-traces/trace1`
* `machine/my-traces/node-traces/server`
* `embedded/my-traces/node-traces/client`


Metadata quirks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A compcls:source.ctf.fs component makes some efforts to support as many
CTF traces as possible, even those of which the metadata is malformed
or implements specification bugs.

In particular:

* If the component detects that the trace was produced by LTTng, it sets
  the `monotonic` clock class as absolute so that different LTTng traces
  are directly correlatable. An LTTng trace has its `tracer_name`
  environment constant starting with `lttng`.

* If the `timestamp_begin` or `timestamp_end` packet context field
  type exists, but it is not mapped to a clock class, and there's
  only one clock class at this point in the metadata stream, the
  component maps it to this unique clock class.

* If an enumeration field type's label starts with `_`, the component
  removes the starting `_` character. This is needed to accomodate
  an eventual variant field type which refers to the enumeration field type
  as its tag and which has equivalent choice names also starting
  with `_` (the `_` must be removed from field and choice names as
  per CTF{nbsp}1.8.2).


INITIALIZATION PARAMETERS
-------------------------
The following parameters are optional unless indicated otherwise.

param:clock-class-offset-ns (integer)::
    Value to add, in nanoseconds, to the offset of all the clock classes
    that the component creates.
+
You can combine this parameter with the param:clock-class-offset-s
parameter.

param:clock-class-offset-s (integer)::
    Value to add, in seconds, to the offset of all the clock classes
    that the component creates.
+
You can combine this parameter with the param:clock-class-offset-ns
parameter.

param:path='PATH' (string, mandatory)::
    Path to the directory to recurse for CTF traces.


PORTS
-----
Output
~~~~~~
For each opened trace, the component creates one output port for each
effective data stream. The name of a data stream output port is the
normalized (no `..` or `.` elements) absolute path to the corresponding
data stream file, or to one of the corresponding data stream files if
there's more than one.


QUERY OBJECTS
-------------
`metadata-info`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can query the `metadata-info` object for a specific CTF trace to get
its plain text metadata stream as well as whether or not it is
packetized.

Parameters:

`path` (string, mandatory)::
    Path to the CTF trace directory which contains the `metadata` file.

Returned object (map):

`text` (string)::
    Plain text metadata.

`is-packetized` (boolean)::
    True if the metadata stream is packetized.


`trace-info`
~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can query the `trace-info` object for a set of CTF traces to get
information about the data streams they contain, their intersection time
range, and more.

This query object requires that the processed CTF traces have the
`timestamp_begin` and `timestamp_end` fields in their packet context
field types.

Parameters:

`path` (string, mandatory)::
    Path to a directory to recurse to find CTF traces.

Returned object (array of maps, one element for each found trace):

`name` (string)::
    Trace name, as per the explanations in the <<trace-naming,Trace
    naming>> section.

`path` (string)::
    Trace path.

`range-ns` (map)::
    Full time range of the trace.
+
--
`begin` (integer)::
    Beginning time (ns since Epoch) of the trace.

`end` (integer)::
    End time (ns since Epoch) of the trace.
--

`intersection-range-ns` (map)::
    This entry only exists if there is a data stream intersection range.
+
--
`begin` (integer)::
    Beginning time (ns since Epoch) of the trace's data stream
    intersection.

`end` (integer)::
    End time (ns since Epoch) of the trace's data stream intersection.
--

`streams` (array of maps, one element for each trace's effective data stream)::
+
--
`paths` (array of strings)::
    Absolute paths to the data stream files which are part of this
    data stream.

`class-id` (integer)::
    Numeric ID of the data stream's class.

`range-ns` (map)::
    Full time range of the data stream.
+
--
`begin` (integer)::
    Beginning time (ns since Epoch) of the data stream.

`end` (integer)::
    End time (ns since Epoch) of the data stream.
