@brief CTF IR field path.

@endcode

A CTF IR <strong><em>field path</em></strong> represents an absolute
path to a field in the hierarchy of a
\link ctfirtraceclass CTF IR trace class\endlink, of a
\link ctfirstreamclass CTF IR stream class\endlink, or of a
\link ctfireventclass CTF IR event class\endlink.

As a reminder, here's the structure of a CTF packet:

@imgpacketstructure

Sequence and variant \link ctfirfieldtypes CTF IR field types\endlink
can return a field path to resp. their length field and tag field
with resp. bt_ctf_field_type_sequence_get_length_field_path() and
bt_ctf_field_type_variant_get_tag_field_path().

A field path has a <em>root scope</em> which indicates from which of the
six CTF scopes to begin. It also has a list of structure field <em>path
indexes</em> which indicate the path to take to reach the destination
field. A path index set to -1 means that you need to continue the lookup
within the current element of an array or sequence field.

As with any Babeltrace object, CTF IR field path objects have
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting">reference
counts</a>. See \ref refs to learn more about the reference counting
management of Babeltrace objects.
