@brief CTF IR packet.

@code
#include <babeltrace/ctf-ir/packet.h>
@endcode

A CTF IR <strong><em>packet</em></strong> is a container of packet
fields, that is, of the <strong>trace packet header</strong> and
<strong>stream packet context</strong> fields.

As a reminder, here's the structure of a CTF packet:

@imgpacketstructure

You can create a CTF IR packet \em from a
\link ctfirstream CTF IR stream\endlink with bt_packet_create(). The
stream you use to create a packet object becomes its parent.

When you set the trace packet header and stream packet context fields of
a packet with resp. bt_packet_set_header() and
bt_packet_set_context(), their field type \em must be equivalent to
the field types returned by resp. bt_trace_get_packet_header_type()
and bt_stream_class_get_packet_context_type() for its parent trace
class and stream class.

You can attach a packet object to a \link ctfirevent CTF IR
event\endlink object with bt_event_set_packet().

As with any Babeltrace object, CTF IR packet objects have
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting">reference
counts</a>. See \ref refs to learn more about the reference counting
management of Babeltrace objects.

bt_notification_event_create() \em freezes its event parameter on
success, which in turns freezes the event's associated packet object.
This is the only way that a CTF IR packet object can be frozen.
You cannot modify a frozen packet: it is considered immutable,
except for \link refs reference counting\endlink.
