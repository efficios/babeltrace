babeltrace-intro - Introduction to Babeltrace


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This man page is an introduction to the Babeltrace project.

The <<what-is,WHAT IS BABELTRACE?>> section lists the parts of the
project and shows the major changes from Babeltrace{nbsp}1 to
Babeltrace{nbsp}2 while the <<concepts,BABELTRACE CONCEPTS>> section
defines the core concepts of Babeltrace.

The <<graph-repr,TRACE PROCESSING GRAPH REPRESENTATION>> section shows
how some <<concepts,concepts>> are visually represented in other
Babeltrace man pages.


[[what-is]]
WHAT IS BABELTRACE?
-------------------
Babeltrace is an open-source software project of which the purpose is
to process or convert
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_(software)[traces].

The Babeltrace project includes the following parts:

[[libbabeltrace]]Babeltrace library (libbabeltrace)::
    A shared library with a C API.
+
With libbabeltrace, you can programmatically create <<plugin,plugins>>
and <<comp-cls,component classes>>, build and run <<graph,processing
graphs>>, and more (see the <<concepts,BABELTRACE CONCEPTS>> section for
more details about those concepts). All the other Babeltrace parts rely
on this library.

[[babeltrace-1]]`babeltrace` command::
    A command-line interface which uses libbabeltrace to load plugins,
    create a trace processing graph, create components, and run the
    graph.
+
You can also use `babeltrace` to list the available plugins or to query
an object from a component class.
+
See man:babeltrace(1).

[[python-bindings]]Babeltrace Python bindings::
    A Python{nbsp}3 package which offers a Pythonic interface of
    libbabeltrace.
+
You can perform the same operations which are available in libbabeltrace
with the Python bindings, but in a really easier way and with less code.

Babeltrace project's plugins::
    The Babeltrace <<plugin,plugins>> shipped with the project.
+
Those plugins are not special, in that they only rely on libbabeltrace
and you don't need them to use libbabeltrace, man:babeltrace(1), or the
Python bindings.
+
The Babeltrace project's plugins are:
+
--
`ctf`::
  Common Trace Format input/output, including the LTTng live source.
+
See man:babeltrace-plugin-ctf(7).

`lttng-utils`::
  Graph utilities specific to http://lttng.org/[LTTng] traces.
+
See man:babeltrace-plugin-lttng-utils(7).

`text`::
  Text input/output.
+
See man:babeltrace-plugin-text(7).

`utils`::
  Graph utilities (muxer, trimmer, counter, dummy sink).
+
See man:babeltrace-plugin-utils(7).
--

Python plugin provider::
    A shared library which libbabeltrace tries to load to add support
    for Babeltrace plugins written in Python.
+
The package you use to write a Python Babeltrace plugin is the one
provided by the Python bindings.


Changes since Babeltrace{nbsp}1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This man page is an introduction to Babeltrace{nbsp}2, a rewrite of
Babeltrace{nbsp}1 with a focus on extensibility and flexibility.

Babeltrace{nbsp}1 exists since 2010. The major improvements brought by
Babeltrace{nbsp}2 are:

* Full plugin support: any user can distribute a Babeltrace plugin and,
  as long as <<libbabeltrace,libbabeltrace>> finds it, any application
  linked to libbabeltrace can load it and use it.
+
Plugins are not just input and output formats: they provide source,
filter, and sink <<comp-cls,component classes>> so that you can connect
specialized, reusable components together in a graph to create a
customized trace conversion or analysis device.

* In order to support user components, all the objects of libbabeltrace
  have a reference count. The possible reference cycles are handled
  internally so that the library's API is clean and predictable. The two
  reference counting functions, `bt_get()` and `bt_put()`, are all you
  need to manage the lifetime of any Babeltrace object.

* All the parts of the Babeltrace project run on the major operating
  systems, including Windows and macOS.


[[concepts]]
BABELTRACE CONCEPTS
-------------------
This section defines the main concepts of the Babeltrace project. These
concepts translate into types and functions in
<<libbabeltrace,libbabeltrace>> and its <<python-bindings,Python
bindings>>, but also as command-line actions and options in the
<<babeltrace-1,`babeltrace` command>>. The other Babeltrace man pages
assume that you are familiar with the following definitions.

Some Babeltrace concepts are interdependent: it is normal to jump from
one definition to another to understand the big picture.

[[comp-cls]]Component class::
    A reusable class from which you can instantiate one or more
    <<comp,component>> instances.
+
There are three types of component classes used to instantiate the three
types of components (source, filter, and sink).
+
A component class provides methods, one of which is an initialization
method, or constructor, to create a component. You pass _initialization
parameters_ to this method to customize the created component. For
example, the initialization method of the compcls:src.ctf.fs component
class accepts a mandatory manparam:source.ctf.fs:path parameter which is
the file system path to the trace(s). It also accepts an optional
manparam:source.ctf.fs:clock-class-offset-ns parameter which is an
offset, in nanoseconds, to add to all the clock classes found in the
traces's metadata.

[[comp]]Component::
    A node within a <<graph,trace processing graph>>.
+
There are three types of components:
+
--
Source component::
    An input component which produces <<notif,notifications>>.
+
Examples: CTF files input, log file input, LTTng-live input, random
event generator.

Filter component::
    An intermediate component which can discard the notifications it
    receives, transform them, augment them, sort them, or create new
    ones.
+
Examples: filter which removes notifications based on an expression,
filter which adds debugging information to selected events, notification
multiplexer, trace trimmer.

Sink component::
    An output component which consumes notifications and usually writes
    them to one or more formatted files.
+
Examples: log file output, CTF files output, text output on the
console.
--
+
Components are connected together within a <<graph,trace processing
graph>> through their <<port,ports>>. Source components have output
ports, sink components have input ports, and filter components have
both.
+
A component is the instance of a <<comp-cls,component class>>. The terms
_component_ and _component instance_ are equivalent.
+
Within a trace processing graph, each component has a unique name. This
is not the name of its component class, but an instance name. If `human`
is a component class name, than `John` could be a component name.

[[port]]Port::
    A connection point, on a <<comp,component>>, from which are sent or
    to which are received <<notif,notifications>> when the <<graph,trace
    processing graph>> is running.
+
An output port is where notifications are sent. An input port is where
notifications are received. Source components have output ports, sink
components have input ports, and filter components have both.
+
An output port can only be connected to a single input port at a given
time.
+
A filter or sink component receiving notifications from its input ports
is said to _consume_ notifications.
+
The link between an output port and input port is a <<conn,connection>>.
+
A component can dynamically add and remove ports while a graph is
running. For example, a compcls:filter.utils.muxer component always
makes sure that it has at least one available input port.

[[conn]]Connection::
    The link between an output <<port,port>> and an input port through
    which <<notif,notifications>> flow when a <<graph,trace processing
    graph>> is running.

[[notif]]Notification::
    An atomic element sent from an output <<port,port>> to an
    input port.
+
A source <<comp,component>> produces notifications, while a sink
component consumes them. A filter component can both consume and
produce notifications.
+
The main types of notifications are:
+
--
Event::
    A trace event record within a packet.

Packet beginning::
    The beginning of a packet within a stream.
+
A packet is a container of events.

Packet end::
    The end of a packet within a stream.

Stream beginning::
    The beginning of a stream.
+
A stream is a container of packets.
+
Usually, a given source component's output port sends packet and
event notifications which belong to a single stream.

Stream end::
    The end of a stream.

Discarded events::
    A count of discarded events within a given time interval for a given
    stream.

Discarded packets::
    A count of discarded packets within a given time interval for a
    given stream.
--

[[graph]]Trace processing graph::
    A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_graph[filter graph] where
    nodes are <<comp,components>> and <<notif,notifications>> flow from
    output <<port,ports>> to input ports.
+
You can build a trace processing graph with
<<libbabeltrace,libbabeltrace>>, with the <<python-bindings,Babeltrace
Python bindings>>, or with the man:babeltrace-run(1) and
man:babeltrace-convert(1) commands.
+
When you _run_ a trace processing graph, the sink components consume
notifications from their input ports, making all the graph's components
work one notification at a time to perform the trace conversion or
analysis.

[[plugin]]Plugin::
    A container of <<comp-cls,component classes>> as a shared library.
+
Each component class within a plugin has a type (source, filter, or
sink) and a name. The type and name pair is unique within a given
plugin.
+
<<libbabeltrace,libbabeltrace>> can load a plugin (`.so` or `.dll` file)
at run time: the result is a plugin object in which you can find a
specific component class and instantiate it within a <<graph,trace
processing graph>> as a <<comp,component>>.
+
The <<babeltrace-1,`babeltrace` command>> uses the
'TYPE.PLUGIN.COMPCLS' format to identify a specific component
class within a specific plugin. 'TYPE' is either `source`, `filter`,
or `sink`.
+
You can list the available Babeltrace plugins with the
man:babeltrace-list-plugins(1) command.

[[query]]Query::
    An operation with which you can get a named object from a
    <<comp-cls,component class>>, possibly with the help of query
    parameters.
+
The plain text metadata stream of a CTF trace and the available LTTng
live sessions of a given LTTng relay daemon are examples of queries.
+
You can use the man:babeltrace-query(1) command to query a component
class's object.


[[graph-repr]]
TRACE PROCESSING GRAPH REPRESENTATION
-------------------------------------
In the Babeltrace man pages, a component is represented with a box. The
box has the <<comp-cls,component class>> type, <<plugin,plugin>> name,
and component class name at the top. Just below, between square
brackets, is its component instance name within the <<graph,trace
processing graph>>. Each <<port,port>> is represented with an `@` symbol
on the edge of the component box with its name inside the box. Output
ports are on the right edge while input ports are on the left edge.

For example, here's a source component box:

----
+------------+
| src.ctf.fs |
|  [my-src]  |
|            |
|    stream0 @
|    stream1 @
|    stream2 @
+------------+
----

This one is an instance of the compcls:src.ctf.fs component class named
`my-src`. It has three output ports named `stream0`, `stream1`, and
`stream2`.

A trace processing graph is represented with multiple component boxes
connected together. The <<conn,connections>> are arrows from output
ports to input ports.

For example, here's a simple conversion graph:

----
+------------+    +-----------------+    +------------------+
| src.ctf.fs |    | flt.utils.muxer |    | sink.text.pretty |
|    [ctf]   |    |     [muxer]     |    |      [text]      |
|            |    |                 |    |                  |
|    stream0 @--->@ in0         out @--->@ in               |
|    stream1 @--->@ in1             |    +------------------+
|    stream2 @--->@ in2             |
+------------+    @ in3             |
                  +-----------------+
----

Note that input port `in3` of component `muxer` is not currently
connected in this example.

Sometimes, we symbolically represent other resources which are consumed
from or produced by components. In this case, arrows are used, but they
do not go to or from port symbols (`@`). For example, in the graph above,
the `ctf` component consumes a CTF trace and the `text` component
prints to the console, so here's a more complete diagram:

----
   CTF trace
       |
.------'
|  +------------+    +-----------------+    +------------------+
|  | src.ctf.fs |    | flt.utils.muxer |    | sink.text.pretty |
'->|    [ctf]   |    |     [muxer]     |    |      [text]      |
   |            |    |                 |    |                  |
   |    stream0 @--->@ in0         out @--->@ in               |
   |    stream1 @--->@ in1             |    +--+---------------+
   |    stream2 @--->@ in2             |          |
   +------------+    @ in3             |          '---> Console
                     +-----------------+
----

Here's another example of a more complex graph which splits a specific
stream using some criteria:

----
+------------+    +-----------------+    +------------------+
| src.ctf.fs |    | flt.utils.muxer |    | sink.text.pretty |
|  [ctf-in]  |    |     [muxer]     |    |      [text]      |
|            |    |                 |    |                  |
|    stream0 @--->@ in0         out @--->@ in               |
|    stream1 @--->@ in1             |    +------------------+
|    stream2 @-.  @ in2             |
+------------+ |  +-----------------+      +-------------+
               |                           | sink.ctf.fs |
               |                           |  [ctf-out0] |
               |  +-------------------+    |             |
               |  | flt.some.splitter | .->@ in          |
               |  |     [splitter]    | |  +-------------+
               |  |                   | |
               '->@ in              A @-'  +-------------+
                  |                 B @-.  | sink.ctf.fs |
                  +-------------------+ |  |  [ctf-out1] |
                                        |  |             |
                                        '->@ in          |
                                           +-------------+
