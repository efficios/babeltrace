Babeltrace /ˈbæbəltreɪs/, an
https://efficios.com/[EfficiOS] project, is an open-source
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_(software)[trace]
manipulation framework.

The **_{bt2}_** project offers a library with a
https://babeltrace.org/docs/v{btversion}/libbabeltrace2[C{nbsp}API],
https://babeltrace.org/docs/v{btversion}/python/bt2[Python{nbsp}3 bindings],
and a
https://babeltrace.org/docs/v{btversion}/man1/babeltrace2.1/[command-line tool]
(CLI) which makes it very easy for mere mortals to view, convert,
transform, and analyze traces.

{bt2} is also the reference parser implementation of the
https://diamon.org/ctf/[Common Trace Format] (CTF), a flexible
trace format which various tracers and tools such as
https://lttng.org/[LTTng] and
https://barectf.org/[barectf] produce natively.
The {bt2} library and its Python bindings can read and write CTF traces.

See the {bt2} https://babeltrace.org[official website], in
particular the
https://babeltrace.org/docs/v{btversion}/man7/babeltrace2-intro.7[`**babeltrace2-intro**(7)`]
manual page, to learn more about the project.

====
The Babeltrace project exists since 2010.

In 2020, {bt2} was released. {bt2} is a complete rewrite of the library,
Python bindings, and CLI. It's plugin-based and offers much more
features and potential than Babeltrace{nbsp}1 while delivering
comparable performance.

Some Linux distributions still provide packages for the
Babeltrace{nbsp}1 project. Both projects can coexist on the same system
as there are no conflicting files.

This README documents the **{bt2}** project.

=== Procedure

To build {bt2}:

. **If you build from a Git clone**, do:
+
[role="term"]
----
$ ./bootstrap
----
+
This generates the `configure` script and other important files.

. [[conf]]Configure the project:
+
[role="term"]
----
$ ./configure
----
+
--
The following options can modify the build:

`--enable-api-doc`::
    Build the {bt2}{nbsp}C{nbsp}API HTML documentation.

`--enable-built-in-plugins`::
    Statically link the official plugins into the
    `babeltrace2` executable.

`--enable-built-in-python-plugin-support`::
    Statically link the Python plugin provider into the
    `babeltrace2` executable.

`--enable-debug-info`::
    Build the https://lttng.org/[LTTng] debug information filter
    component class
    (https://babeltrace.org/docs/v{btversion}/man7/babeltrace2-filter.lttng-utils.debug-info.7/[`filter.lttng-utils.debug-info`]).

`--enable-man-pages`::
    Build the {bt2} manual pages.

`--enable-python-bindings`::
    Build the `bt2` Python bindings.
+
You can set the path to custom `python3` and `python3-config` programs
with the `PYTHON` and `PYTHON_CONFIG` environment variable.

`--enable-python-bindings-doc`::
    Build the `bt2` Python bindings documentation.

`--enable-python-plugins`::
    Build support for {bt2} Python plugins.

The following environment variables can modify the build:

`BABELTRACE_DEBUG_MODE`::
    Set to `1` to enable the debug mode.
+
The debug mode enables more run-time assertions to detect bugs while
developing the {bt2} project.

`BABELTRACE_DEV_MODE`::
    Set to `1` to enable the <<dev-mode,developer mode>>.
+
The {bt2} developer mode enables more precondition and postcondition
assertions to detect C{nbsp}API usage errors.

`BABELTRACE_MINIMAL_LOG_LEVEL`::
    Set the build-time, minimal logging level for all the modules
    of the project.
+
Set to `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, or `INFO`.

`BABELTRACE_PLUGIN_PROVIDERS_DIR`::
    Installation directory of {bt2} plugin providers.

`BABELTRACE_PLUGINS_DIR`::
    Installation directory of {bt2} official plugins.

Run `./configure --help` to list all the available options and
environment variables.
--

. Build {bt2}:
+
[role="term"]
----
$ make
----

To install {bt2}:

* Run:
+
[role="term"]
----
# make install
----

[[dev-mode]]
=== Build {bt2} for plugin or application development

If you're developing a {bt2} plugin or an application which uses
libbabeltrace2, we recommend to:

* Build {bt2} from source in _developer mode_.
+
The {bt2} developer mode enables more precondition and postcondition
assertions to detect C{nbsp}API usage errors.
+
The
https://babeltrace.org/docs/v{btversion}/libbabeltrace2[{bt2}{nbsp}C{nbsp}API documentation]
always lists the precondition and postconditions of
functions.
+
Set `BABELTRACE_DEV_MODE=1` when you <<conf,configure>> the {bt2} build.

* Use _TRACE_ as the minimal logging level at build time to have
  access to more logging, should you need it to debug your plugin or
  application.
+
Set `BABELTRACE_MINIMAL_LOG_LEVEL=TRACE` when you <<conf,configure>>
the {bt2} build.

{bt2} development build configuration command line example:

[role="term"]
----
$ BABELTRACE_DEV_MODE=1 BABELTRACE_MINIMAL_LOG_LEVEL=TRACE ./configure
----

{bt2} development build configuration with Python support example:

[role="term"]
----
$ BABELTRACE_DEV_MODE=1 BABELTRACE_MINIMAL_LOG_LEVEL=TRACE ./configure \
  --enable-python-bindings --enable-python-plugins
----

See the
https://babeltrace.org/docs/v{btversion}/libbabeltrace2[{bt2}{nbsp}C{nbsp}API
documentation] for more information.

== Community

Babeltrace was born to parse CTF traces produced by LTTng{nbsp}2.0 and
to pretty-print their events.

Even though {bt2} is independent from the LTTng project today, their
communities remain very close, which is why they share some
communication channels and services:

Mailing list::
    https://lists.lttng.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/lttng-dev[lttng-dev]
    (mailto:lttng-dev@lists.lttng.org[lttng-dev@lists.lttng.org])

IRC channel::
    irc://irc.oftc.net/lttng[`#lttng`] on the OFTC network

Bug tracker::
    https://bugs.lttng.org/projects/babeltrace[{bt2} bug tracker]

GitHub project::
    https://github.com/efficios/babeltrace/[efficios/babeltrace]

Continuous integration::
    https://ci.lttng.org/view/Babeltrace/[{bt2} jobs]
    on the LTTng CI

Code review::
    https://review.lttng.org/q/project:babeltrace[{bt2} project]
