NAME
----
babeltrace-plugin-utils - Babeltrace's utilities plugin


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Babeltrace `utils` plugin contains common, generic utility component
classes which you can use in any processing graph.

See man:babeltrace-intro(7) to learn more about the Babeltrace
project and its core concepts.


COMPONENT CLASSES
-----------------
compcls:filter.utils.muxer::
    Multiplexes the notifications received on its multiple input ports
    by time to its single output port.
+
See man:babeltrace-filter.utils.muxer(7).

compcls:filter.utils.trimmer::
    Discards all the received events with a timestamp less than a given
    beginning timestamp and greater than a given end timestamp,
    effectively ``cutting'' the traces.
+
See man:babeltrace-filter.utils.trimmer(7).

compcls:sink.utils.dummy::
    Receives the notifications from its single input port and discards
    them (does absolutely nothing with them). This is useful for
    testing and benchmarking a trace processing graph application,
    for example man:babeltrace(1).
+
See man:babeltrace-sink.utils.dummy(7).

compcls:sink.utils.counter::
    Prints the number of notifications received from its single input
    port, either once at the end or periodically.
+
See man:babeltrace-sink.utils.counter(7).
