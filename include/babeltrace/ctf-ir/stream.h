@note
See \ref ctfwriterstream which documents additional CTF IR stream
functions exclusive to the CTF writer mode.

A CTF IR <strong><em>stream</em></strong> is an instance of a
\link ctfirstreamclass CTF IR stream class\endlink.

You can obtain a CTF IR stream object in two different modes:

- <strong>Normal mode</strong>: use bt_ctf_stream_create() or
  bt_ctf_stream_create_with_id() with a stream class having a
  \link ctfirtraceclass CTF IR trace class\endlink parent
  \em not created by a \link ctfwriter CTF writer\endlink object to
  create a default stream.
- <strong>CTF writer mode</strong>: use bt_ctf_stream_create() with
  a stream class having a trace class parent created by a CTF writer
  object, or use bt_ctf_writer_create_stream().

A CTF IR stream object represents a CTF stream, that is, a sequence of
packets containing events:

@imgtracestructure

A CTF IR stream does not contain, however, actual \link ctfirpacket CTF
IR packet\endlink objects: it only acts as a common parent to identify
the original CTF stream of packet objects.

As with any Babeltrace object, CTF IR stream objects have
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting">reference
counts</a>. See \ref refs to learn more about the reference counting
management of Babeltrace objects.
