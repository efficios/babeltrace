NAME
----
babeltrace-sink.utils.dummy - Babeltrace's dummy sink component class


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Babeltrace compcls:sink.utils.dummy component class, provided by the
man:babeltrace-plugin-utils(7) plugin, once instantiated, receives
notifications from its input port and discards them (does absolutely
nothing with them).

A compcls:sink.utils.dummy sink component can be useful to run a trace
processing graph with no sink side effect, for example to perform
benchmarks. You should prefer this component class for such tasks
instead of, for example, using a compcls:sink.text.pretty component and
sending its output to `/dev/null`, as a compcls:sink.text.pretty
component still performs pretty-printing operations.
