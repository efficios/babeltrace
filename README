BabelTrace - Trace Format Babel Tower
Mathieu Desnoyers, EfficiOS Inc.
September 2010

This project provides trace read and write libraries, as well as a trace
converter. A plugin can be created for any trace format to allow its conversion
to/from another trace format.

The main format expected to be converted to/from is the Common Trace
Format (CTF). The latest version of the CTF specification can be found at:

  git tree:   git://git.efficios.com/ctf.git
  gitweb:     http://git.efficios.com/?p=ctf.git

The CE Workgroup of the Linux Foundation, Ericsson, and EfficiOS have
sponsored this work.


BUILDING
--------

	./bootstrap (skip if using tarball)
	./configure
	make
	make install
	ldconfig


DEPENDENCIES
------------

To compile Babeltrace, you will need:

	gcc 3.2 or better
	libc6 development librairies
	  (Debian : libc6, libc6-dev)
	  (Fedora : glibc, glibc)
	glib 2.22 or better development libraries
	  (Debian : libglib2.0-0, libglib2.0-dev)
	  (Fedora : glib2, glib2-devel)
	uuid development libraries
	  (Debian : uuid-dev)
	  (Fedora : uuid-devel)
	libpopt >= 1.13 development libraries
	  (Debian : libpopt-dev)
	  (Fedora : popt)

For developers using the git tree:

This source tree is based on the autotools suite from GNU to simplify
portability. Here are some things you should have on your system in order to
compile the git repository tree :

- GNU autotools (automake >=1.10, autoconf >=2.50, autoheader >=2.50)
  (make sure your system wide "automake" points to a recent version!)
- GNU Libtool >=2.2
  (for more information, go to http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)
- Flex >=2.5.35.
- Bison >=2.4.

If you get the tree from the repository, you will need to use the "bootstrap"
script in the root of the tree. It calls all the GNU tools needed to prepare the
tree configuration.
